## How do I run this bot?
To run a Discord bot, you will need to have a Discord bot account, a server to run the bot on, and a local development environment set up with the necessary libraries and dependencies.

Once you have created your bot account and invited it to your server, you will need to install the necessary libraries and dependencies for your bot. This will usually involve using a package manager such as `npm` for JavaScript to install the required packages.

Once your development environment is set up and your bot's code is written, you can run your bot by executing the code on your local machine. This will typically involve running a command in your terminal or command prompt, such as node bot.js for a JavaScript bot like this one.
